# How to add stocks in a large number of existing items in an inventory location and branches?



### **How to add stocks**

1. Click on Inventory
2. Click on Inventory locations
3. Choose the inventory location where you want to add stocks.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to add to your stock in branches, go to stores/branches.
{% endhint %}

4. Click on Stores / Branches
5. Similarly, under the inventory location, choose the store/branch where you want to add stocks.
6. Getting back to the inventory location, you will see a "add stock" button on the right side of the top.
7. Click on Add stocks
8. This is the detail page for adding stocks. You may also download an example in csv format for reference.
9. Click on Next Step
10. Click to choose a file or drag and drop here.
11. These are the items that I intend to upload to my chosen location. \*GlutaGen Z - 20 pcs \*Apple Cider - 20 pcs \*Collagen - 0 pc \*Frozen collagen - 2 pcs



    Please keep in mind that zero stocks will not be kept there. Only existing inventory items will be added, and the current and new additional quantities will be combined.
12. As you can see from my inventory items, GlutaGen Z, Apple Cider, and Collagen already exist. Frozen collagen is not present, and it will be rejected once uploaded.
13. After you've added the csv file, click the next step button.
14. If you see this two checked in green highlighted words, it means you can continue on to the next phase.
15. Click on Import Data
16. Please wait while your data is imported.
17. As you can see, just three products were imported because the other one was not registered.



    Note: You may also download the rejected items as well as the imported items if you choose.
18. To finish, click on the close button.
